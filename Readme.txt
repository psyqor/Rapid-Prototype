To make a new Rails application for rapid prototyping simply run
 Rails new [project_name] -m rapid_prototype.rb
where you substitute [project_name] for your project's name.

This will setup a new Rails application for rapid protoyping. It will
copy over all files necessary to start coding immediately. You
will also be able to use the rapid prototyping generator which can be 
found in your new project directory under lib/generators/rapid/scaffold_generator.rb
Consult the USAGE file found under  lib/generators/rapid/scaffold/USAGE to discover
its uses.
