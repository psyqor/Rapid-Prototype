Description:
    The rapid:scaffold generator extends the rails scaffold by styling each view with twitter-bootstrap.
    It is aimed to be used for rapid prototyping of model driven applications

Example:
    rails generate rapid:scaffold person name:string age:integer

    This will create:
        a new person model, database migration, controller and a set of CRUD views with twitter-bootstrap styling

Extra functionality:
	Adding a link to the navbar:
	
	    To add a link to the navbar corresponding to your new model add the flag '--add-to-nav' after your generate statement.
	    e.g.  rails generate rapid:scaffold person name:string age:integer --add-to-nav
	    
	    Note: To delete this entry, you can find it in helpers/navbar_helper#navbar_tabs
	
	Adding an item to the home page:

	    To add an item to the home page corresponding to your new model add the flag '--add-to-home-page' after your generate statement.
	    e.g.  rails generate rapid:scaffold person name:string age:integer --add-to-home-page

	    Note: To delete this entry, you can find it in the views/static_pages/home.html.erb file
